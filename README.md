### **AWS DeepRacer: Crafting the Perfect Reward! üèéÔ∏è**

Welcome to my AWS DeepRacer project! This repository is all about the brain behind the race car: the **reward function**. In AWS DeepRacer, the reward function is a Python script that tells your autonomous car how well it's doing on the track. The better the reward function, the faster and smarter your car becomes!

#### **What You'll Find Here üöÄ**

This repository contains different versions of reward functions I've developed and experimented with for my AWS DeepRacer models:

*   **`reward.py`:** My primary reward function, designed to optimize lap times and keep the car on track.
*   **`reward_02.py`:** An alternative reward function, perhaps exploring different strategies or parameters.
*   **`record.txt`:** Likely contains logs or notes from training runs, detailing performance metrics.
*   **`references.txt`:** Useful links or resources that helped in developing the reward functions.

#### **My DeepRacer Journey ‚ú®**

My goal with these reward functions is to:

*   **Maximize Lap Completion:** Ensure the car stays on the track and finishes laps consistently.
*   **Optimize Speed:** Encourage the car to drive faster while maintaining control.
*   **Learn from Experience:** Fine-tune the reward logic based on simulation results and real-world performance.
*   **Explore Reinforcement Learning:** Understand how different reward structures influence the learning process of the autonomous agent.

#### **Tech I'm Using üõ†Ô∏è**

*   Python
*   AWS DeepRacer platform (for training and simulation)
